I am a Brazilian researcher in Ecology, currently working on Plant Ecology and Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning as a result of my interest in conservation and sustainability. My research focus is on the influence of climate change in plant communities. I also have interests in ecological restoration and ecology of invasive plants.
